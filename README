=========================================================
ABOUT QMEM:

Qmem is a script designed to describe the memory usage of a
SGE cluster. If your cluster has memory restrictions, the
usage of qstat solely is not enough to monitor its state 
properly. Qmem attempts to solve that.





=========================================================
HOW TO USE IT:
In order to use qmem, your execution hosts must have 
configured "PER HOST" the following COMPLEX ATTIBUTES:
        h_vmem = set to the host total memory
        num_jobs = set to the host num of processors

You can exchange "num_jobs" by "slots" here in the code 
lines 75 and 76. We opted to use "num_jobs" instead of
"slots" because this allows us to submit jobs that override 
it and request 0 " If you want to stick to "slots",simply 
change it in lines 75 and 76.

Once you have configured both complex attributes in all 
hosts, you are ready to run qmem.
